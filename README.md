Please refer to [Github pages (pkgdown)
Documentation](https://affini-t-tx.github.io/CensusHLA/) to get started,
and to find data from Roy2025.

CensusHLA is an R package designed to facilitate the analysis of HLA
allele frequencies across the United States using census data and other
external datasets. The package provides tools for importing, processing,
and visualizing HLA frequency data, as well as integrating it with
spatial and demographic information. It is particularly useful for
researchers working in population genetics, immunogenetics, and public
health.
